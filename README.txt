CS51 Final Project

To compile and run our code, simply run main.py

More specifically, navigate to the CS51FinalProjectWeather folder, and in the terminal, execute:

python main.py

This will output all of the scraped data in the terminal, followed by the various steps in the matrix math, followed by a trigger to launch the in-browser interface.
